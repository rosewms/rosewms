## About me

Welcome! My name is Rose Williams, here's a little about me:

I'm a technical communications specialists focused in technical writing and community support! Job titles I have held include information engineer, technical writer, and content developer.

In my most recent position, I documented enterprise and SaaS products as well as an OSS project. My previous fields of work include education technology (learning management systems), healthcare technologies (electronic healthcare records), security (AWS and API integrations), 
domain and email management, and a distributed SQL query engine (data connectors and open source). Throughout all of my work 
experiences I have contributed to product specific "preventative documentation" including UX writing, micro-copy, error messages, 
and in some cases, deprecation messaging.

I love working with companies to create accessible documentation and learning experiences. I enjoy learning new technical topics 
so I can translate them for customers. One of my favorite projects was creating a guided learning series to help customers 
onboard more quickly.
