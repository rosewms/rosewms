## About me

Welcome! My name is Rose Williams, here's a little about me:

I'm a #WriteTheDocs Meetup Team Lead and community organizer. Job titles I have held include information engineer, technical 
writer, content developer, and a technical communication specialist. Throughout my previous jobs I have advocated for inclusive 
work places, mental health, and opportunities for LGBTQIA+, mil-spouses, and veterans.

My predominate work experience has been documenting SaaS products! My previous fields of work include education technology 
(learning management systems), healthcare technologies (electronic healthcare records), security (AWS and API integrations), 
domain and email management, and a distributed SQL query engine (data connectors and open source). Throughout all of my work 
experiences I have contributed to product specific "preventative documentation" including UX writing, micro-copy, error messages, 
and in some cases, deprecation messaging.

I love working with companies to create accessible documentation and learning experiences. I enjoy learning new technical topics 
so I can translate them for customers. One of my favorite projects was creating a guided learning series to help customers 
onboard more quickly.
